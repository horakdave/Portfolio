    <h2>My Life Story</h2>
    <h3>How I got into coding</h3>
    <p>I got to coding at just 11 years old when I was looking at those developer youtubers like Randy or Dani adding whatever they want to their own games
        and for me it was just so fascinating how they had the freedom to do basically anything if they wanted to.
        So that was the thing that really motivated me to code and have that freedom too and my dad really supported my interest in coding because he is a data scientist. 
        Nowadays Im more of a software / web development guy than a game developer because some of the things that I made are actually usable like when I really wanted to go on a techdays program in SSPŠ
        highschool and made a bot that was checking every few hours if I can buy an entry ticket first and that Ill be the first one to know about it. And I did the same with the math classes that were supposed to prepare me for JPZ 
        on SSPŠ. And the good thing about coding is that I can help others too like when my mom needed to sort a lot of files in some folders with a specific name and so on.</p>

    <h3>Future Plans</h3>
          <p>The only thing Im focusing on right now is getting accepted to SSPŠ highschool because it is the best one in the whole Czech Republic and one of the better ones in europe.</p>
    
    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <p>My motivation is to make a seuccesful company/companies that not only would make me money but they would bu usefull for other people too.</p>
