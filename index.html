    <h2>My Life Story</h2>
    <h3>How I got into coding</h3>
    <p>I began coding at the age of 11 inspired by developers like Randy or Dani who showcased their ability to add anything they wanted to their games on YouTube. 
The freedom they had fascinated me motivating me to pursue coding. 
My dad a data scientist supported my interest. 
While I started with game development I now lean more towards software and web development. 
Notably I created a bot to check for techdays program entry tickets ensuring I was among the first to know. 
Similarly I made a bot that checked for my preparation for JPZ in SSPŠ high school's math classes. 
The versatility of coding allows me to assist others like helping my mom organize files with specific names in various folders.</p>

    <h3>Future Plans</h3>
          <p>The only thing Im focusing on right now is getting accepted by SSPŠ highschool because it is the best one in the whole Czech Republic and one of the better ones in europe.</p>
    
    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <p>My motivation is to make a seuccesful company/companies that not only would make me money but they would be usefull for other people too.</p>
